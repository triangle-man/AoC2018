* Data first -- structs help. It's all about the data model

* Little functions are great. Write more of them.

* I really must understand different recursion schemes. Map and fold I
  understand. Many of these puzzles require recursing down one structure and up
  another. Many require a reduction step that is not simply cdr. Is this
  indicative that the recursive data structure was incorrectly defined? 
  
  For example, in day 7, "goals" was really a DAG. "Mapping" in this case meant
  (a) linearly ordering; (b) iterating over that order. 

* I think my general plan of "be one step more general" is about right.
